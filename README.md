# Task Center

A linux app for managing all To Dos, tasks and projects

## Overview
Task Center is a modern, intuitive and powerful task and to-do list manager for Linux. It is intended to be a desktop
companion to [Tasks.org](https://github.com/tasks/tasks). It is completely open sourced and licensed under GPL3+ and is
coded in Python 3 and Gtk+3.

Further details, download and usage instructions and other resources can be found in the docs folder or on the main site
at https://task-center.github.io

## Features

### Start and Due Date
Tasks can be given start and due dates and times. These start and due dates can be used to sort and filter tasks

### Subtasks
Every task can have an unlimited number of nesting subtasks.

### Tags
Tasks can be assigned multiple tags to assist with grouping and filtering.

### Powerful Recurrence Options
Task Center also supports repeating tasks. Tasks can repeat on a minutely, hourly, daily, monthly or yearly basis. The
number of intervals are also configurable (eg, every 2 days, 6 weeks, 3 months, etc.). In addition, tasks that repeat
weekly can be set to repeat on specific weekdays (Eg. every week on monday, wednesday and friday). Tasks that repeat
every month can also repeat on specific weekdays of that month (Eg. the first saturday of the month).
Task Center also supports tasks repeating from their completion date or from their start and due date.
Task Center also allows for setting tasks to stop repeating, either after a set number of repeats or after an end date.

### Powerful Filters
In Task Center, tasks can be sorted, grouped and filtered by a powerful programmable filter system. For
example, a filter can be created to show all overdue tasks with priority of medium

### Multiple Data Sources
Task Center can synchronize task data with multiple sources including:
- CalDAV
- DecSync
- Local Database
